# (!) Due to latest changes to the Spotify Client Winfy does not work properly (!)

Winfy is a free mini player for the desktop client of [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) for Windows. If you use a Mac you should definitely try [Simplify](http://mmth.us/simplify/).

Winfy displays the current track, artist and song cover in a small and fancy window right on your desktop. From there you can play/pause the current track or skip forward or backward.

### Requirements

Winfy runs on Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8. It also needs the Microsft .NET Framework 4.0 in order to run. The Winfy setup will install it for you if you haven't installed it already.
