## Uhm yeah, thats me

Hi, my name is Max. I'm 27 years old and hate self descriptions.

I'm a software developer who lives in Berlin and is dedicated to Electronic Dance Music.
In case you are an EDM friend too, I put some of my favourite sets on the [Music](/music) section of my site. 

You can follow me on [Twitter][twitter], check out my repos on [Github][github] or read my [blog][blog].
